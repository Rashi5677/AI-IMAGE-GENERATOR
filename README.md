# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
An AI image generator using React (Vite), Node.js, Express, and MongoDB allows users to generate images based on text prompts. The front-end, built with React and Vite, sends user prompts to a Node.js and Express backend, which interacts with an AI model (like OpenAI's DALL-E) to generate images. The generated images are processed and returned to the frontend, where they are displayed to the user. MongoDB can be used to store user inputs, generated images, or logs. This combination creates a full-stack application for generating and managing AI-generated images.
